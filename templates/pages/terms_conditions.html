                    <h3 class="h5">Deposits and Waitlists</h3>
                    <p>GroupBuy operates on a unique model that requires a minimum number of buyers for each product (Minimum Order Quantity or "MOQ"):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>By joining a product waitlist, you agree to pay a non-refundable 5% deposit of the wholesale price</li>
                        <li>This deposit reserves your place in line for the product</li>
                        <li>If the MOQ is not reached within the specified timeframe, your deposit will be fully refunded</li>
                        <li>If the MOQ is reached, you will be notified to complete your payment for the remaining balance</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3 class="h5">Order Fulfillment</h3>
                    <p>After the MOQ is reached:</p>

                        <li>You must complete your payment within 7 days of notification</li>
                        <li>Failure to complete payment may result in cancellation of your order and loss of your deposit</li>
